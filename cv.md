## About Myself: 
I`m a student of Gagarin State Techical University of Savatov.My field of study is Information Systems and Technologies. A lot of technologies are taught in this direction. It allows, for  each student can choose a profession according to their preferences. There is an office and a training center of Epam in Saratov. In my second year, I decided to go to them for training, which led me to The Rolling Scopes School platform. I like to do programming and learn something new. Therefore, I hope that my training will take place at my pleasure.
